Watch and Shutdown

This project is for the minidlna project.  For people that want to shutdown 
their desktop PC via their media player.  The aim is for this software to
watch a particular video file and when its played it will initiate an 
operating system shutdown.

I'm targetting just Linux 2.6.15 or later and using just C code.
